# Ember-virtual-scrollkit

This addon is designed to work with [Ember Collection](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-collection). Alone, Ember Collection is insufficient for iOSUIWebview use because iOS does not send scroll events until momentum scrolling has finished.

This project gives you UIWebView-capable virtual scrolling on top of Ember-Collection. It achives this via Zynga Scroller.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-virtual-scrollkit
```
